package me.srrapero720.watermedia.core;

/**
 * Doing development of this class is kinda hard
 * Explanation: This class/core was intended to replace "ResourcesCore" using a lazy method
 * to extract resources from JAR using a specified path
 * For example:
 * <pre>LazyResourcesCore.extractFrom(IMediaLoader, "vlc/win-x64")</pre>
 * and without a mapping list that method can get all files and subfolders inside that folder
 * and extract every single one
 * <br>
 * I need help doing this, is NOT funny for me and is kinda frustrating <br>
 * HELP INFO: <br>
